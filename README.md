# Cases for the Psion Organiser 2

## Work in progress

These models are not perfect, work will be needed to use them. In particular the narrower top slot case halves do not fit together properly.

There are some OpenSCAD models here for the Psion Organiser 2. There's a wider top slot case and a smaller toip slot case.

The models are OpenSCAD and are parametric I may have used magic numbers here and there, but they should be customisable.
